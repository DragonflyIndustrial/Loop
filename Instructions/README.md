# Loop Instructtions
 
#Crucial information

- Calibrate your Z-offset to get a good first layer (too close to the bed makes the prints adhere more which we don't want)
- Choose the right material and brand.  I've tested so far: ABS, PETG, CF-PETG, PLA. The quality from various vendors can differ, make sure to test new materials first (even if they are the same material type)
- Calibrate the first layer temperature --> lower temperatures makes the part stick less to the buildplate which we want
- Use the textured PEI springsteel sheet from Prusa (depending on the batch number, you might get different results)
- Make sure to wash your buildplate with dish soap every once in a while and to not use any adhesives on the bed itself. 

#Build instructions

What worked best for me:

a) Insert all brass heat inserts

b) Mount the following parts beforehand:
	- Belt tensioner Top RIGHT ++ Z-Axis Top RIGHT
	- Bearing block TOP ++ Z Axis Top LEFT
	- Ejection arm pivot point ++ Z Axis Bottom LEFT
	- Ejection arm endtsop ++ Z Axis Bottom RIGHT (only pre tighten for now)
	- Top axis ++ Bearing block TOP ++ GT2 60T 8mm pulley ++ GT2 20T 8mm as shown in the picture below

c) Assembly instructions
	1) Move the Z-Axis all the way up via the LCD and fix the X-gantry with tape or zipties to the frame

	2) Mount the feet and the mechanics cover first while laying the machine on the PSU side

	3) Cut the zipties from the Z-motor cables --> unscrew the Z-axis motor mounts --> unscrew the Z-axis rod --> unscrew the Z-axis bracets and change them with the mod parts --> reverse all steps

	4) Cut the zipties/tape from the X-gantry --> move the Z-Axis down manually roughly to Z=150mm --> unscrew all top Parts and change them with the mod parts (including the mechanism gripper)
	
	5) Mount the top belt first --> tighten the lose ends with the top screw of the mechanism gripper --> Make sure that the Belt Idler top RIGHT does not interfeer with the mechanism gripper when the gripper is on its idle position (see picture below) --> thighten the Belt Idler top RIGHT until you the belt has resonable tension
