# 3D Printing instructions
 
All STL-files are orientated in the correct orientation, just throw them into your slicer and off you go.
No support needed.
Depending on your setup (enclosure, printer on the table...) use at least PETG as material, ABS or PC would be even better.
Parts should have at leats 3-5 perimeters and 30% infill.
I printed all parts with a 0.6mm nozzle and 0.3mm layer height.
